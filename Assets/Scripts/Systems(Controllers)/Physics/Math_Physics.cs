// This is a psuedo library for math functions

/* 
*   This object will most likely spread out and or morph, what I'm trying to get at, is that I'm not entirely sure exactly what to do with it.
*   What I do know is that we need Easing functions, 
*   Might be cool to include wrappers here, for say floating point division
*   Might also be cool to include like overload methods for specific use-cases, say we just want speed for an operation instead of velocity..
*   in a method that has a Vector3 argument, we can invoke some callback method from this object that returns speed from velocity or get fancy with it even idk.
