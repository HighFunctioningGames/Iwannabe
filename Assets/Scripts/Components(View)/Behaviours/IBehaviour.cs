*   So what we can do in the future with this structure is to use this as a 
*   wrapper for jobs to take advantage of unity's multithreading and burst compiler
*   I'm structuring most things with this in mind, the architecture is a MVVM bastard child
*   issa big fat baby but a stable baby ready for a growth spurt. ANYHOW, 
*   This is split up and abstracted in a way as to make for an easy transition
*   into unity's ECS paradigm
