  2nd person skate simulator thatâ€™s zainy, gay and post-modern. The game takes place within the vision of the 'sidekick', a camerawoman. You skate around making skate films to upload on the internet to get money to then go spend on clothes and accessories. However, the sidekick has her own life to attend to.

  Two burnouts, Liam and Vixia, earn a meager living filming skate videos together in their hometown. Vixia, a naive free-spirit with a big heart, bigger biceps, and a camera for a head, has dreams of being an investigative journalist. However, without a college education or any real work experience, her dreams lie stagnant. That is until, one day she stumbles into a conspiracy that runs deep within her town, a story perfect for leveraging her way into a job. Choosing to ditch her commitments with her best friend Liam, she gets entangled in a web of secrets; which gets even more complicated when she falls for someone else caught in the chaos. Can she uncover the truth? Will she score a date with this mystery woman? Will she be able to land her dream job? And will Liam still be there for her if she does?
